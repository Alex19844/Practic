If you dance, I'll dance
And if you don't, I'll dance anyway
I've got my eye on you (I was the girl who was on your side)
I was the girl who was on your side
I've got my eye on you
Say yes to heaven (I was the girl who was on your side)
I was the girl who was on your side
Say yes to me
Say yes to me

If you go, I'll stay
You come back, I'll be right here
Like a barge at sea
In the storm, I'll stay clear
I've got my mind on you (I was the girl who was on your side)
I was the girl who was on your side
I've got my mind on you
Say yes to heaven (I was the girl who was on your side)
I was the girl who was on your side
Say yes to me
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
