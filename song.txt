If you dance, I'll dance
And if you don't, I'll dance anyway
I've got my eye on you (I was the girl who was on your side)
I was the girl who was on your side
I've got my eye on you
Say yes to heaven (I was the girl who was on your side)
I was the girl who was on your side
Say yes to me
Say yes to me
